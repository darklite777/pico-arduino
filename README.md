## Raspberry PI Pico - Arduino API

Recently I was receiving my Raspberry PI Pico and I had the opportunity to play around with it. Actually most of the time I spent reading the Manuals...
The conclusion: interesting - but a little bit too complicated. So I was quite happy to read that Arduino plans to add an official support for this Microcontroller. 

However I did not want to wait for the official support to be available, so I decided to make my own Arduino API available as a separate project. In the meantime the official Arduino support is avaiable, but I still think that __this project is quite useful because of it's unique design goals__:

## Design goals

- Provide a __complete implementation__ of the Arduino API so that we easliy use Arduino Sketches and Arduino Libraries on the Raspberry Pico
- Provide __additional__ easy to use C++ classes for the __Pico specific__ functionaity  
- Keep the Pico specific build process using __cmake__ so that we can use all existing C++ libraries. 
- Use __this project as__ just an additional __cmake library__
- Provide a __full set of examples__ 

In a nutshell we can profit from both: the advantages of the Arduino and the advantages of the Pico SDK.

## Installation

1. First you need to install the Pico C Framwork. Please [follow the instructions](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) and do not forget to define the PICO_SDK_PATH environment variable (REMEMBER TO USE '/' FOR PATH).

The subsequent installation steps are only necessary, if you want to use the ArduinoSketch.cmake includes e.g. to build the provided examples:

2. Clone this project with 

```
git clone https://github.com/pschatzmann/pico-arduino
```
2. Define the environment PICO_SDK_ARDUINO_PATH variable to point to the project location (REMEMBER TO USE '/' FOR PATH).


## Examples

Details can be found in the [examples directory](examples)

## Documentation

The generated [Class Documentation](https://pschatzmann.github.io/pico-arduino/doc/html/) can be found in the doc folder

## Pinout

It helps to know the functions of the pins. Here is a copy of the pinout provided by the official [Raspberry Pi Pico Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/):

If a method is requiring a pin, you can provide the GPIO number as integer or use the corresponding GP name as given in the sheet above.

The following calls are all identical:

```
  digitalWrite(25, HIGH);                      // turn the LED on using integer
  digitalWrite(GP25, HIGH);                    // the same with GP25 define
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);             // the same with Arduino defines 
  digitalWrite(PICO_DEFAULT_LED_PIN, HIGH);    // the same with Pico defines 
```

## Deploying a compiled Sketch

Deployment is very easy - just press the button on your Pico while plugging it to your computer via USB. This will automatically mount the Pico as external drive (RPI-RP2).
Finally you just need to copy the generated uf2 file from your build directory to the drive.

That's it!
